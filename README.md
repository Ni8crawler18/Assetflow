# Assetflow

AssetFlow is a cross-chain gateway solution that simplifies the onboarding process for Ethereum users into the Polkadot ecosystem. By leveraging their existing MetaMask wallets, users can seamlessly transfer ETH to wETH (wrapped Ethereum on Moonbeam) and gain access to Polkadot's parachains and decentralized applications (DApps). This frictionless process eliminates the need for creating new wallets, learning complex cross-chain bridging mechanisms, or dealing with Polkadot's multi-account system.

The app has been embedded as a widget into Farcaster, enabling MetaMask users to experience the power of Polkadot applications within a familiar social platform with minimal effort.
